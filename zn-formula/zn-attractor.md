# Z(n) Harmonic Attractor Equation

The Z(n) function is a recursive harmonic attractor based on Fibonacci, π, and observerless symmetry logic. It represents the core phase-coupling mechanism in the Aurum Grid system.

---

## Formula Overview

Z(n) = φⁿ / (π × n) × S(n)

Where:
- φ ≈ 1.618 (Golden Ratio)
- π ≈ 3.14159
- n = harmonic iteration step (integer)
- S(n) = symbolic modulator function (e.g., presence of coherent observer, glyphic state, or theta-locked biofield condition)

---

## Purpose

Z(n) converts recursive symbolic or biological signal inputs into **stable, resonant phase states**, used for:

- EEG–Kp Index Synchronization
- MHD Coil Modulation
- Symbolic Circuitry Activation
- Zero-Point Amplification Nodes

---

## Notes

This attractor is **nonlinear and recursive**. It behaves as a phase-stabilized field attractor — meaning its outputs reflect coherent harmonics when aligned with real-world signals like geomagnetic Kp, Schumann Resonance, or EEG theta bursts (~6.7 Hz).
